## Introduction

This README provides a comprehensive guide to various aspects of functions in JavaScript. Functions are a fundamental concept in JavaScript, enabling developers to encapsulate reusable blocks of code and create dynamic and efficient applications. This guide covers different ways of creating functions and explores their flexibility and versatility in JavaScript.

## 1. Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions, also known as function expressions, are functions without a name. They are often used in scenarios where a one-time or callback function is needed. An example of an anonymous function is:

```javascript
const add = function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
};
